/**
 * This is very usefull for testing. Lets say we wanto to test this user userController. Then
 * in our use cases we dont talk to the actuall db. We want to kind simulate that which is much quicker and
 * we dont wanto to make changes in the real db by doing test cases. That is bad. So with this
 * interface we can still pass a user controller in our repo letter on and we can give this functions
 * our own definitions. For example we can just keep track of a hassmap or a list that just keeps track of all
 * our users just for the test case. And with tat we can see if everything is fines in other circumstances.
